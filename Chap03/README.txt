Genomic info for step 1 to 3 can be downloaded from https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/downloads/Current_Release/AfumigatusAf293/
The raw data for the mRNA experiment are available in the bioproject PRJNA374516 on GEO
The needed files are a fasta containing the genome and a gff3 with the information on the genes, files location are to be set accordingly

STAR and samtools need to be installed on the machine for step 1 to 3 to function

Step 4 is not needed to generate the content of the thesis, it wasused in a previous version of the data analysis and is reported as it is a useful tool with some dataset

The fumigatus BS-genome package needs to be available in R for step number 5 and following to work, repo here: https://github.com/LucaInvernizzi/Aspergillus-fumigatus-BSgenome
